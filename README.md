## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for deploying an ExpressJS application using a CI/CD pipeline on AWS. The pipeline utilizes GitHub Actions for code integration, AWS CodeCommit for source control, AWS CodeBuild for build automation, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment.

## Prerequisites

1. *AWS Account:* Ensure you have an active AWS account.
2. *GitHub Repository:* Have your ExpressJS project in a GitHub repository.
3. *AWS CLI:* Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Setting Up GitHub Actions

1. *Create GitHub Repository:*
   - Initialize a new repository on GitHub for your project.
   
2. *Configure GitHub Actions:*
   - Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
   - Select a workflow template or create a new one.
   
3. *Write Workflows:*
   - Create a .github/workflows/main.yml file in your repository with the following content

## Configuring AWS IAM

1. *Create IAM User:*
   - Go to the IAM section in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new IAM user with programmatic access.
   
2. *Attach Policies:*
   - Attach the necessary policies for CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and Elastic Beanstalk to the IAM user.
   
3. *Store Credentials Securely:*
   - Save the access key ID and secret access key for the IAM user securely.

## Setting Up AWS CodeCommit

1. *Create CodeCommit Repository:*
   - Navigate to CodeCommit in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new repository for your project.
   
2. *Connect GitHub Repository:*
   - Use AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console to clone the CodeCommit repository.
   - Push your GitHub repository content to the CodeCommit repository.

3. *Test Connection:*
   - Ensure that the connection between GitHub and CodeCommit is successful by pushing a commit and verifying it in CodeCommit.

## Setting Up AWS CodeBuild

1. *Create Build Project:*
   - Go to CodeBuild in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new build project.
   
2. *Configure buildspec.yml:*
   - In your project root, create a buildspec.yml file with the following content

3. *Test Build Process:*
   - Trigger a build in CodeBuild and ensure it completes successfully.

## Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk

1. *Create Elastic Beanstalk Application:*
   - Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new application and environment.
   
2. *Configure Environment:*
   - Set up the environment with the necessary configurations (e.g., instance type, platform).
   
3. *Deploy Sample Application:*
   - Deploy a sample application to ensure the environment is set up correctly.

## Integrating AWS CodePipeline

1. *Create CodePipeline:*
   - Go to CodePipeline in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new pipeline.
   
2. *Add Source Stage:*
   - Select CodeCommit as the source provider and choose your repository.
   
3. *Add Build Stage:*
   - Add CodeBuild as the build provider and select your build project.
   
4. *Add Deploy Stage:*
   - Add Elastic Beanstalk as the deploy provider and select your environment.

## Testing the Deployment Pipeline

1. *Push Code Changes:*
   - Make changes to your code and push to the GitHub repository.
   
2. *Monitor Pipeline Execution:*
   - Go to CodePipeline in the AWS Management Console and monitor the pipeline execution.
   
3. *Ensure Successful Deployment:*
   - Verify that the code changes are successfully deployed to Elastic Beanstalk.

## Implementing Auto-Scaling

1. *Configure Auto-Scaling:*
   - Go to the Elastic Beanstalk environment settings.
   - Enable and configure auto-scaling based on your application's requirements.
   
2. *Set Up Scaling Policies:*
   - Define scaling policies based on metrics such as CPU utilization or request count.
   
3. *Test Auto-Scaling:*
   - Simulate traffic to your application and verify that auto-scaling works as expected.

## Security and Backup

1. *Review Security Groups:*
   - Ensure that security groups are configured to allow only necessary traffic.
   
2. *Set Up Automated Backups:*
   - Configure automated backups for your data.
   
3. *Conduct Security Audit:*
   - Perform a security audit to ensure that all components are secure.

## Final Review and Handoff

1. *Review Setup:*
   - Conduct a thorough review of the entire setup for completeness and correctness.
   
2. *Final Deployment Test:*
   - Perform a final deployment test to ensure everything works as expected.
   
3. *Handoff:*
   - Document the setup and hand off the project to Blog and live
